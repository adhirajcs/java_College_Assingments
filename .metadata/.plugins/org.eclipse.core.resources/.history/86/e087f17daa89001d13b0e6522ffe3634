 5. Consider an example of book shop which sells books &amp; video tapes. Itâ€™s modeled by Book &amp;
Tape classes. These two classes are inherited from the abstract class called Media. The Media
class has common data members such as title &amp; publication. The Book class has data
member for storing a no. of pages in a book &amp; Tape class has the playing time in a tape. Each
class will have method such as read ( ) &amp; show ( ). Write a program that models this class
hierarchy &amp; processes objects using reference to base class only.
