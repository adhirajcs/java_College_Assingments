/* 4. Inherit a class from Thread and override the run( ) method. Inside run( ), print a
message, and then call sleep( ). Repeat this three times, then return from run( ).
Put a start-up message in the constructor and override finalize( ) to print a shut-
down message. Make a separate thread class that calls System.gc( ) and
System.runFinalization( ) inside run( ), printing a message as it does so. Make
several thread objects of both types and run them to see what happens. */
